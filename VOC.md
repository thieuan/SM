<h1>VOC</h1>
<br>1. Option for menu radius size (arc coverage)
<br>2. Option for item/icon zoom level. Useful for lots of use cases  
<br>3. Option for background including custom image  
<br>4. Trigger icon shadow, and shadow opacity level. For better visibility  
<br>5. Option for 2nd-tier by means of double-clicking the central menu icon. Upon doing so, the icons will instantly switch or "flip" to the 2nd-tier items (animation optional but would be cool)  
<br>6. Option to autohide trigger icon when a particular app is in the foreground, then autoshow once that app is in the background  
<br>7. Option to auto-reset or keep the menu item positions (for the next triggering instance) 
once an item is clicked, or if action was cancelled by user. This is because some items are hidden away if all 10 slots are used up  
<br>8. Fix for menu scroll jumpiness. Scrolling is not  smooth enough, it doesn't have inertia setting  
<br>9. Option for per-item custom icon; and icon pack selection  
<br>10. Icon shape/mask setting: circle, square, squircle, etc...  
<br>11. Option for visible unread notifications/counter for applicable icons: Messaging, Email, etc.  
<br>12. Option for central focus/zoom. When an item is in line horizontally with the central menu, its icon and text becomes larger. Great for visibility  
<br>13. Haptic feedback option; and click sound option. Including vibration and volume level settings  
<br>14. Option for visual cue when item is clicked. A nifty animation will do.  
<br>15. Make it obvious if an item is no longer clickable along its arc. Dim the disabled section of the screen.   
<br>16. Just wish I could drag the dot icon on the top or buttom. Or just for it to show up on the home page and not on everything

<h2> New comming </h2>
<br>17. I would like them to add gestures when you move the floating icon
<br>18. Support devices without camera flash
<br>19. Backup and restore
<br>20. The quality of the screen recorders improvement
<br>21. You could apply an icon pack to the displayed favorites. You had some options for the "touch spot" shape: Half circle, square, line, bar
